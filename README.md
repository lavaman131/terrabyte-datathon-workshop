# ML for Environmental Science

## Introduction

This repository contains sample code and data for exploring machine learning for environmental science.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new conda environment named 'ml' with Python 3.10 and install essential packages
conda create -n ml python=3.10 \
    pandas \
    openpyxl \
    numpy \
    scipy \
    seaborn \
    matplotlib \
    scikit-learn \
    jupyterlab \
    ipython

# Activate the environment
conda activate ml

# Later you can install other packages like this:
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost

# To deactivate the environment, run:
